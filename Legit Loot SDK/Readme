In Borderlands, enemies often spawn with 'stock' gear, which I assume is to make balancing easier. Anytime an enemy doesn't drop their gear, it's because they rolled stock gear (with the exception of Lance not dropping their assault shotguns, but that's likely an oversight, and the Underdome).

This mod makes it so that almost every enemy will spawn with legit gear and drop them. This means you'll see a lot more loot, and enemies will be a bit tougher.
