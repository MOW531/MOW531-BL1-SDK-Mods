Adds a resettable playthrough 3 that scales to your level.

Changes from other playthroughs:
	Fast-Travel in playthrough 3 is unlocked after Skags At The Gate.

Known Issues:
	The Fast-Travel list might be outdated after a reset. Save-quitting should fix it.
	The game will freeze for a little bit at the 'Press Start' screen because some commands need to run in the background, and this is the earliest place I found.
	Playthrough 3 is unlocked by beating playthrough 2. To unlock Playthrough 3 on a save that has already beaten playthrough 2, set 'Playthrough 2 Unlocked' to '2' in WillowTree.
