Adds a resettable playthrough 3 that scales to your level.

Changes in 1.1.2:
	Fixed DLC 3 and 4 not scaling properly.

Changes in 1.1.1:
	Fixed the Fast-Travel list not updating.

Changes in 1.1.0:
	Now playthrough 3 starts at Skags At The Gate when you first enter it (I forgot about it when I was testing).
	The amount of ammo received from pickups is now the playthrough 2 amount (thanks EvanDeadlySins!).

Changes from other playthroughs:
	You start at Skags At The Gate.
	Fast-Travel in playthrough 3 is unlocked after Skags At The Gate.

Known Issues:
	The Fast-Travel list might be outdated after a reset. Save-quitting should fix it.
	The game will freeze for a little bit at the 'Press Start' screen because some commands need to run in the background, and this is the earliest place I found.
	Playthrough 3 is unlocked by beating playthrough 2. To unlock Playthrough 3 on a save that has already beaten playthrough 2, set 'Playthrough 2 Unlocked' to '2' in WillowTree.
