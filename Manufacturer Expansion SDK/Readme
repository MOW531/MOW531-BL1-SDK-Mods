Requires Custom UI SDK (https://github.com/MOW531/MOW531-BL1-SDK-Mods/tree/main/Custom%20UI%20SDK)

Corazza was a manufacturer that was cut very early on in the development of BL1. The only things we have of them are their color scheme, a low-res image of their logo, and that the name is Italian for armor. In this mod, they've been brought back as a secondary manufacturer (coms, shields, and grenade mods) that has a focus on explosives. Corazza makes explosive resistance shields and homing grenades.

We know even less about Polaris; they were the new manufacturer for Borderlands Online, at least one of their guns looked alien, and we have their logo. In this mod, they've been brought back as a primary manufacturer (guns, coms, shields, and grenade mods) that has a focus on high damage but low fire rate. Polaris makes SMGs, repeaters, machine pistols, assault shotguns, semi-auto snipers, grenade launchers, explosive blast shields, and singularity grenades.

Each character gets 2 new class mods plus a loyalty com for Lilith and Roland, and there are 6 new legendaries by Polaris, one for each weapon type they make.

This mod also makes Nova shields deal damage so that they aren't useless.

Everything is subject to change (especially the legendaries, as I don't think they fit in well).
